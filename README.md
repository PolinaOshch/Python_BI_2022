# numpy_challenge.py
This script helps to work with numpy arrays and matrices. 
There are following functions: 
- *matrix_multiplication* multiplying two matrices
- *multiplication_check* requires list with matrices and outputs True, if they could be multiplied , and False, if they couldn't.
- *multiply_matrices* requires list with matrices and outputs product, if they could be multiplied , and None, if they couldn't.
- *compute_2d_distance* , requires two arrays with 2d-coordinates and computes the distance between them
- *compute_multidimensional_distance*, requires two arrays with multiple coordinates and computes the distance between them 
- *compute_pair_distances* , requires 2d matrix and computes pairwise distance

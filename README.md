Homework 1 is a tool which helps you to manipulate with nucleic acid sequence. The code has been written 
via Python3. The options are: 
- transcribe DNA into RNA 
- reverse RNA or DNA strain
- find a complement sequence for DNA/RNA 
- and make a reverse complement 

The tool asks you a taks (transcribe, reverse, complement or reverse complement), please type it. 
Then type a sequence. The result appears if you don't confuse:). Then the tool asks for another task. 
if you want to finish, type exit in the field for task.
